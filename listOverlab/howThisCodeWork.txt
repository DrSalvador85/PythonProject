## Step 1: Import random
We import the random module to generate random numbers.

```python
import random

Step 2: Create two lists

We create two lists, each containing 9 random integers between 1 and 10.

Step 3: Print the lists

We print the lists so we can see their content.

Step 4: Find common elements

We loop through the first list and check if each element exists in the second list. If yes, we add it to the common list.

Step 5: Print the common elements

Finally, we print the list of common elements
